# Team Contract - CropBox

This is an informal contract to ensure that all team members have a common understanding of what is expected in terms of work standards, communication, division or work, and conflict resolution.

### Team Members

* Rafael Vincent de Guzman
* Gorav Karwer
* Simon Stasovski

### Strength & Weaknesses

Within the context of this project, what are the strengths and weaknesses that each member brings to the team?

* Rafael Vincent:
  * Strengths: Quick to adapt and pivot to focus on pressing issues, easy to reach and communicate, very flexible
  * Weakness: Working at odd hours, working in short bursts, struggle with long-term planning (likes flexibility, but planning means locking out options)
* Gorav Karwer:
  * Strengths:Ability to design user interfaces (UI) and replicate wireframe design to 90%.
  * Weaknesses: Back-end programming does not inspire me, which slows down my work in this area
* Simon Stasovski:
  * Strengths: I am motivated to work on the backend and I usually finish work a couple of days before the due date which allows me to review my work. I can also work well in high stress situations.
  * Weaknesses: I am not motivated by front-end development which makes my work in this regard slower as I get distracted by work I find more interesting or by other things.

### Definition of “good enough” for this project

What would the team collectively consider “good enough” of an achievement for the project?

Collectively, we consider “good enough” to be a product that we are proud of. We believe that "good enough" means that we have met the project requirements and have produced a high-quality product that demonstrates our understanding of the material and our ability to work effectively as a team. Given the scope of the project, we would like our product to be good enough to impress a prospective employer / target demographic.

### Division of work

How will each member contribute to the project?

* Rafael Vincent de Guzman: I see myself filling in the blanks to help my teammates out. I will use my ability to adapt and be flexible to help and cover work that my teammates have difficulty in. I can also start work quickly if we lack direction.
* Gorav Karwer: I will assist my teammates when there having problems with. Also my  take task that base on my strengths and if the other member needs help, then I can always help each other out.
* Simon Stasovski: I will provide structure to the meetings and allocate tasks to my teammates with their feedback in mind to ensure that we can all complete our tasks by the deadlines given.

### Frequency of communication

How often will the team be in touch and what tools will be used to communicate?

We like to communicate using Discord. We will be doing bi-weekly meetings on Monday and Friday after classes. We will discuss what we worked on the previous days, what we are struggling with and what we have completed. We will have longer meetings on every second Friday since it will be our sprint retrospective as well.

### Response delays

What is a reasonable delay to reply to messages? Is it the same for weekdays and weekends?

It depends on if it's a class day, stage work day or weekend day. During days with classes, if a message appears, we should answer it at the next available break after class or if provided during the class. For stage days, it would be during lunch breaks if messages come in the morning or after the stage work day (accounting for travel) if the message is in the afternoon. As for the weekends, Gorav has work until five therefore, we will not expect him to reply immediately. However, for Rafael and Simon there should be less of a delay unless there was a specified obligation due on the weekend.

### Receiving feedback

How do you prefer to receive feedback? Each member must provide a sample sentence for how they would like to receive constructive feedback from their peers.

(If unsure, assume a hypothetical situation such as you have not completed your work in time or you have not replied to a message in a timely manner).

* Rafael Vincent de Guzman: I like receiving feedback quickly and as direct as possible.

  * Example: “I see what you’re doing, it works, but I think it can be done better with more time.”
* Gorav Karwer:

  * Hey, I hope you're doing well, I heard you had an issue with a problem, did you resolve it? If not how  can I help you out.
* Simon Stasovski:
  I would like to have my teammates be upfront and as straightforward as they feel like they need to be.

  * Example: Hello Simon, you are not updating your Jira issues during this entire sprint. It makes it difficult for us to track and coordinate work. Frankly, it is borderline unacceptable and we want to work to fix it.

### In case of conflict

If a team member fails to communicate as described in this contract or does not respond to constructive feedback, what measures should the other teammate take?

In case of conflict, we should strive to talk it out and communicate between team members. We will provide a three day notice to the individual or individuals that are causing the conflict. If we do not get consistent dialogue, not just one short response but an explanation with a solution, we will escalate it to the teachers.
